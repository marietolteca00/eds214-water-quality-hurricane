# Exceeds spec


# Create two subheaders, one for each spec. (Remember, only some specs are eligible for Exceeds spec!)


#### The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works
- I feel like i explained the process of how i approached the reproducibility attempt and i state what i used how it (I did forget to update this part). Would this be okay with words or do i need to submit a picture of a flowchart


#### The analysis produces the expected output
- I named the variables as i was going which helps the user who is trying to reproduce my workflow follow along and know which variables to use in different sections.



# Create a header called “Collaboration”

- I think it went well when i completed the peer feedback, I was following along the specification section. To my best ability I was going through each section and seeing if they were completed or running. I helped my peer by adding libraries that were missing and here functions to grab R scripts they wanted to use.
